## Overview
Code that supports the tutorial [Testing web applications using Playwright](https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAYCLOUD/Testing+web+applications+using+Playwright) showcasing the integration between [Xray Test Management](https://www.getxray.app/) on Jira and Playwright, using JUnit XML reports.

The test automation code implements a basic [Playwright test](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro/).

## Prerequisites
In order to run this tutorial you need to have Nodejs and install the playwright-test runner.
```
npx playwright install
npm i -D @playwright/test
```

## Running
Tests can be executed locally with the following command
```
PLAYWRIGHT_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME=junit.xml npx playwright test --reporter=junit,line
```

## Submitting results to Jira

Results can be submitted to Jira so that they can be shared with the team and their impacts be easily analysed.
This can be achieved using [Xray Test Management](https://www.getxray.app/) as shown in further detail in this [tutorial](https://docs.getxray.app/display/XRAYCLOUD/Testing+web+applications+using+Playwright).
